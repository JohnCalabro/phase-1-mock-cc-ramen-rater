/*
1. See all ramen images in the div with the id of ramen-menu. 
When the page loads, request the data from the server to get all the 
ramen objects. Then, display the image for each of the ramen using an 
img tag inside the #ramen-menu div.
2. Click on an image from the #ramen-menu div and see all the info 
about that ramen displayed inside the #ramen-detail div and where it 
says insert comment here and insert rating here.
3. Create a new ramen after submitting the new-ramen form. 
The new ramen should be added to the#ramen-menu div.
 The new ramen does not need to persist; in other words, if you 
 refresh the page, it's okay that the new ramen is no longer on the 
 page.
